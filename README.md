INTRODUCTION
------------
A message type and entity reference fields, enabling sending and receiving 
private messages using The Message Stack. Messages of type "Private Message" can 
be sent by creating the private_message message instance with fields referencing 
user entities.

The message_private module includes the following.
+ A message type "Private Message" with entity reference field referencing users
+ A message view, message_private for "User Messages"


DEPENDENCIES
------------
The message_private module requires the following modules:
 * Message (https://drupal.org/project/message)
 * Message Notify (https://drupal.org/project/message_notify)
 * Message UI (https://drupal.org/project/message_ui)


INSTALLATION
------------
 * Install as you would normally install a contributed drupal module. See:
   https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8
   for further information.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
Enabling Permissions: 
 * "View a new message instance for Private Message" &
 "Create a new message instance for Private Message" for users needing to create
 and view private messages.
 * To hide private messages from this view, you must override view provided by 
 Message module: admin/structure/views/view/message/edit

When enabled, the module will provide a new message type "Private Message" and a 
Message Private View.

Message Create Limits:
 * Message creation limits can be managed per role on the module settings form. 
 A message create limit can be set per interval per role. Users with more than 
 one role get the maximum limit by calculating the lowest time per message over 
 each role. Users with the 'bypass private message access control' permission 
 bypass these limitations.


HOW TO USE
----------
To Create messages:
 * Visit /admin/content/message/create/private-message and Save the message to 
 send, or
 * Visit the "Messages" tab detailed below and find the "Create a new message" 
local action.

To View inbox and sent messages:
 * Visit your user page at /user and find the "Messages" tab which displays 
received messages (Inbox local task), the "Sent" local task under that tab which
displays sent messages and the "Group" local task which displays group messages.
   * /user/USER_ID/messages/inbox
   * /user/USER_ID/messages/sent


SECURITY
--------
This module does not come with any security features out-of-the-box, but you can
easily configure your own, using methods and modules of your choice.

E.G:
 * Honeypot and timestamp methods: https://www.drupal.org/project/honeypot
 * CAPTCHA method: https://www.drupal.org/project/recaptcha


DEVELOPMENT AND TEST
--------------------
 * Integrate with Message FOS (FOSMessage) bridge module.
 * Flag module on user entity to block/unblock users from messaging them
 * Flag module on message entity to show/hide (delete) messages from users own 
   display
 * Allow Operations links to display correctly on views, i.e. - show 'View' for
   users with view permissions. Not showing currently due to custom permissions.
 * Integrate with rolereference module or similar to provide sending to users
   within a certain role.
 * Tests should be created in a "tests" folder.
